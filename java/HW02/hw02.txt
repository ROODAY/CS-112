1.
    - The "Public" on line 1 should be lowercase
    - Method f() should be declared to return an int, not an integer
    - Method f() should have a type for its parameter, i.e. f(int x)
    - The if statement on line 3 requires a ==, not a =
    - The if statement on line 3 is missing its curly braces
    - The main method should have parentheses around its parameters, not brackets
    - There is an extraneous curly brace on line 7
    - Line 8 should have System.out.println, not System.println
    - Line 8 is missing a semicolon
    - There is an extraneous end parentheses on line 10
2. It will first print 3.0, because (int) will truncate 3.1415 to 3, and (double) will make the 3 become 3.0. Then, it will infinitely print out 10 on a new line, because the while loop does not have curly braces surrounding the print statement and i being decremented. Therefore, only the print is considered part of the while loop, making it run forever.
3. It will print out "1 2 4 8". This is because the inner loop iterates through the previous elements, and adds them to the current element, which makes each element double the last.
4. It will print out "2 2 6 4 5 6". This is is because it doubles odd numbers smaller than 4, and ignores even numbers and odd numbers greater than 4.
